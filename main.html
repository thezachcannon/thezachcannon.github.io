							<h2>ABOUT</h2>
							<p>We are a family of four in the beautiful Ozarks hills, that strive for happy, healthy golden retrievers.  We think goldens are the best family breed, we love our goldens and they have become a part of the family.  We have a very effective vaccine schedule so by the time the puppy gets to you it will have had at least four vaccines.  We start worming once the puppies are two weeks old and every other week after that.  Our puppies come with a one year health guarantee against genetic defects. Our puppies are handled from the day they are born, our children just can't wait to get their hands on them and play with them as the puppies get older.    When our puppies are weaned they are in a building where they have access to go out into a fenced area to play and potty, the puppies also get to come in the house and play with our kids. We don't let our puppies leave to go to their new homes until they are at least 8 weeks old.</p>
							<p>When purchasing a puppy, please consider all things and make sure that owning one is right for you.  They deserve lots of love and care and in return they will become one of your family members that gives unconditional love and happiness back.  We will be glad to answer any questions and send pictures for your choosing of the perfect puppy for you.  You are very welcome to come for a visit or we meet people partway for delivery and we also ship to most major airports.  You may reach us at 417-254-0025 or bellerran@hotmail.com</p>
